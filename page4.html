        <p>The faculty members at IUB actively contribute to research and regularly publish in peer-reviewed
        journals. In addition to conventional classroom-based teaching, students are actively involved in 
        research from the early stages of their academic journeys. Notably, IUB has exhibited a consistent
        commitment to research, as evidenced by its financial allocations of BDT 3.05 crore, BDT 4.31 crore,
        and BDT 6.1 crore during the fiscal years 2020-21, 2021-22, and 2022-23, respectively.
        This reflects a steady and growing investment in advancing research initiatives at the institution.</p>
        <p>The IUB campus spans across 3 acres, featuring an amphitheater and state-of-the-art laboratories
        dedicated to life, environmental, and social sciences, as well as engineering. The infrastructure 
        includes 95 multimedia classrooms, fully equipped for both physical and online classes. The campus
        is further enriched with an auditorium, separate gymnasiums for men and women, a swimming pool, 
        yoga studio, chess and carrom stations, a table tennis court, a spacious sports complex, and a 
        food court. Additionally, accommodations are provided
        in the form of a dormitory for female students from outside Dhaka and a guest house for visiting scholars.</p>
